# With pnut split across multiple files with many compilation targets and
# options, the size of the compiler is not trivial to measure. gcc's -E option
# can be used to expand the preprocessor directives, but it also includes all
# the code from the #include <> directives which is not code pnut sees and so we
# need something in between that only expands the active #include "" directives.
#
# This script uses the DEBUG_EXPAND_INCLUDES option that preprocess the input
# and prints the characters that are read. Active #include directive are
# expanded meaning that the included file is printed as well. The output is then
# filtered to remove the lines that correspond to the included files.
#
# The result is as if someone had manually replaced the active #include
# directives with the content of the included files.
#
# We then run a few tests to make sure the result is correct:
# - The expanded file still compiles with gcc
# - The result of pnut on the expanded file is the same as the result of pnut on the original file
